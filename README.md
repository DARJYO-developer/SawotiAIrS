## Automatic Irrigation System
<br>
SAMPLE Python code for an Automatic Irrigation System that uses a simple algorithm to determine when to water a garden based on the moisture level of the soil. 
<br>1. This code uses a while loop to continually check the moisture level of the soil. 
<br>2. If the moisture level falls below 30, the code activates the watering system and increases the moisture level by 20. 
<br>3. If the moisture level is above 30, the code prints a message indicating that the moisture level is sufficient and waits for 1 hour before checking again.
<br>
<br>
Also outlined is HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code that can be used to create a website with a user interface for the automatic irrigation system
<br>
<br>
A more COMPLEX code will include additional features such as a user interface and the ability to control a watering system.
